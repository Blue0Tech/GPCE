# GPCE
GPCE (General Purpose Command Executor) is a command executor for many purposes, but it is still under development. It is currently available in C# and Python 3. Work is currently being done on the C# edition, and there is error handling for the whole program. The Python 3 edition is not complete either, but development on that version will be on standby until otherwise stated. Feel free to report any bugs on the website or to shrikaanthpruthvispareemail@gmail.com.
