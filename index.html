We have released a video and installation instructions for Ubuntu (tested on 18.04 in the video, also works on 20.04) at our main website, <a href="http://blue0tech.unaux.com" target="_blank">here</a> <br>
On Windows, the process should be relatively simple, just ensure that the installer is in the same directory that you want the GPCE directory to be in.
